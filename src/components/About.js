          after completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and minor
          in Mathematics. As a frontend software engineer, I enjoy bridging the
          gap between engineering and design - using my technical knowledge to
          create a beautiful product. Solving technical problems when building a
          product that can have a real world impact is what drives my work
          ethic. My goal is to always develop innovative solutions to meet
          customersâ€™ needs and positively impact their lives.
